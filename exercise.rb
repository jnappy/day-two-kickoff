#create a first method called clean_full_name that accepts two parameters: first_name, last_name
#this method should make all the letters of both those paramters lowercase and then capitalize the first letter of each
#this method should return the combination of the first and last name as one string

#ask the user for their first name

#ask the user for their last name

#run the first method and store the results in a variable called full_name

#print the full_name to the screen
